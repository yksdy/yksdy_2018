version 2.0.1 - February 9, 2007
================================
* Minor update, converting all yahoo.com hostnames to yahooapis.com in
  anticipation of Yahoo! converting all of the service hosts.

Version 2.0.0 - June 24, 2006
=============================
* Added the region and site parameters to web search.
* Remove the type parameter (now absent from the YDN docs) from context
  search and added the site parameter.

  the site parameter to video search.

Version 1.1.1 - June 21, 2005
=============================

  search feature.

Version 1.1.0 - April 28, 2005
==============================

  now an explicit setRequestUrl() on every request object.

* Added parsing the ResultSetMapUrl value to local search responses.
* Added context search to SearchClient.
* Added term extraction to SearchClient (aka Content Analysis).
* Added "license" parameter to web search requests.
* API should now work with Java 1.2 (users will need to provide a JAXP
  implementation, Xalan-J 2.6.0 worked fine during testing).
* Added implementations of the new MyWeb services (ListFolders and
  ListUrls).
* HTTP calls now set a User-Agent header of the form
  "Yahoo-Java-SDK/<version>" where the version specified is the version
  of this API.
* Requests will now utilize POST (instead of GET) if the request is too
  large to safely use GET (anything with a request URI longer than 255
  characters).
* Added some code samples. One to show users how to get started with
  the search service stuff and another to show how to get started with
  the My Web service stuff.

Version 1.0.2 - March 11, 2005
==============================
* Added latitude, longitude and sort to Local Search.
* Added country to Web Search.

  implementation since the generated code has dependencies on classes in
  the JaxMe2 JAR files.

Version 1.0.1 - March 6, 2005
=============================
* com.yahoo.search.SearchException changed to extend Exception instead
  of Throwable.

Version 1.0 FCS - February 27, 2005
===================================

* Source package building.
* Packages now explode into a directory named
  yahoo_search_sdk-[bin|src]-${implversion} instead of exploding into the
  current directory.
* Schemas are now stored locally instead of being downloaded from
  api.search.yahoo.com at build time. Connectivity issues were causing
  builds to be too much of a hastle.

===================================
* Updated documentation to point to the new developer site
  (http://developer.yahoo.net/).

Version 1.0 RC1 - February 23, 2005
