Welcome to the Yahoo! Search Web Services Software Development Kit

Here you'll find programming examples to help you get started using
Yahoo! Search Web Services.

Example code in the following languages are included in this SDK:

ColdFusion
C#
Flash (ActionScript and Flex)
Java
JavaScript
Lua
Perl
PHP
Python
Ruby
VB.Net
Widgets (JavaScript and XML)

For each language, other than JavaScript, Flash, and Widgets, a very simple
standalone example named "simpleSearch" is included as well as
a more involved wrapper class that you can use to access most, or
all, of Yahoo!'s Search Web Services. 

JavaScript, Flash, and Widgets, since they are more platform dependent, have their own kind of example(s) provided.
