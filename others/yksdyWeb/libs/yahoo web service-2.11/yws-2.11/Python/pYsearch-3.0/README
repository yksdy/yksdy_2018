Installation
------------

Installation is simple, assuming you have Python v2.2 or later, simply do:

	     $ python setup.py build
	     $ python setup.py install


See the docs and examples for how to use it. We recently moved the
development of pYsearch to be hosted by SourceForge, visit us at

   http://pysearch.sourceforge.net/


Bugs and missing features
-------------------------

* Update the websearch "example" application with support for more search
  services and arguments.

* HTTP error codes are somewhat sketchy.

* I'd like to get this to work properly with both multi-threaded apps and
  asynchronous I/O frameworks. In particular, I need it to work with at
  least Medusa (async-core), and preferably with Twisted as well.

* We have no way of validating that there is 30 or less site arguments.

* Validate Yahoo IDs?

* Validate URLs when passed as query arguments?
